## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Email App Password (5 minutes)

**Gmail:**
- Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
- Enable 2-Step Verification
- Generate App Password for "Mail"
- Copy the 16-character password

**iCloud:**
- Go to https://appleid.apple.com

### 2. Update .env File

Add these lines to your `.env` file:

```bash
IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com
IMAP_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
IMAP_PASSWORD=your-16-char-password
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook 2_lab2_with_replies.ipynb
```

Run all cells from top to bottom. When you reach **Part 4: Email Reply Capability**, you're ready!

## What It Does

🤖 **Automatically responds to email replies** using AI agents  
📧 **Polls your inbox** every 60 seconds for new messages  
🧠 **Analyzes sentiment** (interested/objection/question/not interested)  
🎯 **Routes to specialized agents** based on reply type  
💬 **Maintains conversation history** for context  
📊 **Tracks everything** in OpenAI traces  

## Architecture

```
Email Reply → IMAP Poll → Sentiment Analysis → Route to Agent → Send Response
```

**No server required!** Everything runs in your Jupyter notebook.

## Testing

### Step 1: Test with Manual Reply
```python
# Uncomment in the test cell:
await process_reply(test_reply['from'], test_reply['subject'], test_reply['body'])
```

### Step 2: Limited Monitoring
```python
# Runs 5 checks, then stops
await monitor_emails(check_interval=30, max_iterations=5)
```

### Step 3: Send Yourself an Email
Send an email to your `SENDER_EMAIL` and watch it get processed automatically!
