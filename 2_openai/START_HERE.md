## What You Need to Do (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Get Email App Password (5 min)

**Gmail:**
```
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Search "App passwords" → Generate for "Mail"
4. Copy the 16-character password
```

**iCloud:**
```
1. Go to: https://appleid.apple.com
2. App-Specific Passwords → Generate
3. Copy the password
```

### Step 2: Update .env File (1 min)

Add these 3 lines to your `.env` file:

```bash
IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com
IMAP_EMAIL=johnny.jarecsni@gmail.com
IMAP_PASSWORD=your-16-char-password-here
```

**iCloud users:** Change `IMAP_SERVER` to `imap.mail.me.com`

### Step 3: Run the Notebook (2 min)

```bash
jupyter notebook 2_lab2_with_replies.ipynb
```

1. Run all cells from top to bottom
2. When you reach "Part 4: Email Reply Capability" - you're ready!
3. Test with the manual reply cell first
4. Then start monitoring

## That's It!

No copying cells, no manual edits, no surprises. Just:
1. Get app password
2. Update .env
3. Run notebook

## Need More Details?

- **Setup Instructions:** Open `EMAIL_REPLY_SETUP.md`
- **Overview & Features:** Open `README_EMAIL_REPLIES.md`
- **Troubleshooting:** See `EMAIL_REPLY_SETUP.md` → Troubleshooting section

## Quick Test

Once you've completed the 3 steps above:

```python
# In the notebook, uncomment this line in the test cell:
await process_reply(test_reply['from'], test_reply['subject'], test_reply['body'])
```

You should see the agent analyze the reply and send a response!

## What You Get

✅ Automatic email reply handling  
✅ Multi-agent system (5 specialized agents)

## Bonus: Reusable Tool 🛠️

The `notebook_extender.py` tool used to create this notebook is now **generalized and reusable**!

Use it for future challenges:
```bash
# Add cells to any notebook
python notebook_extender.py source.ipynb output.ipynb --cells new_cells.json

# Or use as Python module
from notebook_extender import extend_notebook, create_code_cell
```

See `NOTEBOOK_EXTENDER_README.md` for full documentation and examples.
