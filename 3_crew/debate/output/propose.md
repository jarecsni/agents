Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to argue that we need strict laws to regulate Large Language Models (LLMs), and I'll tell you why this is not just desirable but absolutely necessary.

First, consider the unprecedented power of these systems. LLMs can generate content indistinguishable from human-created work, spread across the internet at scale, and influence millions. With such power must come proportional responsibility and oversight. Without regulation, we're essentially conducting a massive social experiment without informed consent.

Second, the risks of unregulated LLMs are substantial and well-documented:
- Misinformation can be generated at unprecedented scale and sophistication, undermining our information ecosystem
- Deep fakes and synthetic content threaten to erode trust in media entirely
- Privacy violations occur when these models are trained on personal data without meaningful consent
- Intellectual property theft happens as creative works are scraped without compensation
- Economic disruption looms as automation threatens jobs across sectors

Third, the market alone cannot solve these problems. Companies developing LLMs are incentivized to move quickly and maximize profit, not to consider broader societal impacts. The externalities - the societal costs - are not reflected in their balance sheets. Only regulation can align corporate incentives with public good.

Fourth, precedent shows that technology regulation works. From pharmaceuticals to aviation, industries with high-stakes outcomes are regulated not to stifle innovation but to channel it responsibly. The internet's early days of minimal regulation led directly to many problems we now face with misinformation and privacy.

Fifth, regulation provides clarity and certainty for businesses themselves. Clear rules level the playing field, prevent a race to the bottom on safety, and actually enable innovation by creating stable expectations.

Let me be clear: regulation doesn't mean stopping progress. It means ensuring LLMs develop in ways that benefit humanity rather than harm it. We need rules requiring:
- Transparency about training data and capabilities
- Safety testing before deployment
- Clear attribution and watermarking
- Privacy protections for individuals
- Accountability for harms

The alternative - waiting until after catastrophic harm occurs - is simply irresponsible governance. We didn't wait for multiple planes to crash before creating aviation safety standards. Why would we do so with a technology that could potentially be even more transformative?

The time to act is now, while these technologies are still developing. Strict regulation of LLMs isn't anti-innovation - it's pro-responsible innovation. It's not anti-technology - it's pro-humanity. I urge you to support this motion.
