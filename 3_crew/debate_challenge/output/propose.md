Ladies and gentlemen, I rise today to argue that strict laws regulating Large Language Models are not just desirable but absolutely necessary in our rapidly evolving technological landscape.

First, consider the unprecedented power of LLMs. These systems process and generate human-like text at a scale never before possible, affecting everything from media creation to decision-making processes. With such power comes genuine risk. Without proper regulation, we face potential harms that span from mass misinformation campaigns to privacy violations on an industrial scale.

Second, the market alone cannot regulate itself. Tech companies are driven primarily by profit and competitive advantage, not public welfare. History has repeatedly shown that when powerful technologies remain unregulated, corporations will prioritize growth and market dominance over ethical considerations. The externalities—the social costs—are borne by society, not shareholders.

Third, LLMs present unique challenges to our democratic processes. We've already witnessed how unregulated social media can distort elections and public discourse. LLMs exponentially amplify this threat by generating convincing misinformation at scale. Without regulation, we risk fundamentally undermining the informed citizenry essential to democracy.

Fourth, regulation promotes innovation, not stifles it. Clear regulatory frameworks create a level playing field where companies compete on quality and value, not on who can most aggressively exploit regulatory gaps. Look at how safety regulations in aviation and pharmaceuticals have created industries where innovation thrives within protective boundaries.

Finally, we must address the unprecedented labor market disruptions LLMs will cause. Without regulatory frameworks to manage this transition, millions face unemployment without recourse or support. Strict regulation can ensure these technologies benefit humanity broadly, not just shareholders of tech companies.

The alternative—allowing these powerful systems to develop unchecked—amounts to a vast uncontrolled experiment on society. We don't allow untested pharmaceuticals to be released to the public; why would we allow equally impactful AI systems to develop without oversight?

The question isn't whether we should regulate LLMs, but how quickly and effectively we can implement thoughtful regulation that protects society while allowing beneficial innovation. The stakes are simply too high for inaction.
